### What is GigaStation? {#whatis}
GigaStation is a solution to the pains of hybrid work, keeping data secure while offering a flexible, “work from anywhere” user experience. GigaStation provides a globally distributed, cloud-based, high-performance, virtual-computing replacement for physical workstations that you can connect to from home, work, or pretty much anywhere.

### Prerequisites {#prerequisites}
- **GigaStation Access** - if you don’t already have access to GigaStation, you can request access via the IT Help Center.
- **Okta** - you have to be signed in to Okta to access GigaStation.
- **VPN** - you do NOT need to be connected to VPN to access GigaStation.

### Provision a New Workstation {#provision}
Once you have been granted access to GigaStation you will need to provision a new workstation.
1. Open your favorite browser and navigate to the GigaStation Dashboard.
1. Click **CREATE WORKSTATION**.
1. Give your new workstation a name. Workstation names must be between 4 and 32 characters and can contain both numbers and letters (uppercase or lowercase). The only special characters allowed are underscores, spaces, dashes, and periods.
1. Select a Persona. GigaStation Personas are workstation configurations designed for specific user types. The personas available to you are based on your job role. For more information about personas, see GigaStation - Personas in the IT Help Desk wiki.
1. Select a Region. GigaStation automatically selects the region with the fastest response time, but if you like you can select a different region.
1. Click **CREATE**. Depending on the persona you chose in step 4, it will take between 30 and 120 minutes for GigaStation to provision your workstation, with Base personas taking the least amount of time and Engineering personas the most. A status bar is displayed to keep you updated on the status of your new GigaStation.

### Launch Your New Workstation {#launch}
You can use either Parsec or Teradici to access your GigaStation Workstation.
1. If you don’t have Parsec installed on your computer, see How to install and launch Parsec below.
2. Sign in to Parsec. (For more information about signing in to Parsec, see How to install and launch Parsec below.)
3. Go to the GigaStation Dashboard.
4. Click **OPEN WITH** > **Parsec**.
5. The Windows login screen will appear. Click anywhere on the screen, and enter your Epic password to sign in.
